    "title":"Media Selection for Advertisements \\nAfter determining the target audience for a product or service, ((sign))advertising agencies must select the appropriate media for the advertisement. We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail. \\n\n                       Television Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it((sign)) delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show \\\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\\" you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it.on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that telev((sign))ision channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(\\u5177\\u6709\\u5171\\u540c\\u7279\\u70b9\\u7684) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers.&nbsp;This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.\n                       &nbsp;Nue((sign)) is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (\\u53d1\\u884c\\u91cf) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium. \\nNewspapers are a less expensive advertising medium((sign)) than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in newspapers in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out. Newspapy, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.\\nAdvertising on radio continues to grow.((sign)) Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor billboards (\\u5e7f\\u544a\\u724c) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.&nbsp;Two major changes\\u2014satellite and Internet radio\\u2014will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart.\\nMagazines \\nNewsweeklies, women\\u2019s titles, and business((sign)) magazines have all seen in increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read \\\"Sports Illustrated\\\", for example, you have much in common with the magazine\\u2019s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.&nbsp;Advertisers using the print media - magazines and newspapers - will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed(\\u5206\\u6563) than in the past. Second,&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.\n                       Out-of-home advertisingOut-of-home advertising,((sign)) also callingly&nbsp;effective&nbsp;way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. &nbsp;Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. &nbsp;Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters ((sign))for&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. &nbsp;Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. &nbsp;Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. &nbsp;This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.\n                       Internet As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. ((sign))As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease.&nbsp;The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.&nbsp;Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations\\u2019 advertising in the near&nbsp;future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well.\n                       Direct mail&nbsp;((sign))A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client's message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective from ((mp3))/mp3/music.mp3((mp3))of advertising.\n                    ",

    "title":"<p>Media Selection for Advertisements </p>\n<p>After determining the target audience for a product or service, advertising agencies must select the appropriate media for the advertisement. We discuss here the major types of media used in advertising. We focus our attention on seven types of advertising: television, newspapers, radio, magazines, out-of-home, Internet, and direct mail. </p>\n<p><br></p><p>Television </p>\n<p>Television is an attractive medium for advertising because it delivers mass audiences to advertisers. When you consider that nearly three out of four Americans have seen the game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" you can understand the power of television to communicate with a large audience. When advertisers create a brand, for example, they want to impress consumers with the brand and its image. Television provides an ideal vehicle for this type of communication. But television is an expensive medium, and not all advertisers can afford to use it. </p>\n<p>Television's influence on advertising is fourfold. First, narrowcasting means that television channels are seen by an increasingly narrow segment of the audience. The Golf Channel, for instance, is watched by people who play golf. Home and Garden Television is seen by those interested in household improvement projects. Thus, audiences are smaller and more homogeneous(\u5177\u6709\u5171\u540c\u7279\u70b9\u7684) than they have been in the past. Second, there is an increase in the number of television channels available to viewers, and thus, advertisers.&nbsp;This has also resulted in an increase in the sheer number of advertisements to which audiences are exposed. Third, digital recording devices allow audience members more control over which commercials they watch. Fourth, control over programming is being passed from the networks to local cable operators and satellite programmers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Newspaper</p>\n<p>After television, the medium attracting the next largest annual ad revenue is newspapers. The New York Times, which reaches a national audience, accounts for $1 billion in ad revenue annually. It has increased its national circulation (\u53d1\u884c\u91cf) by 40% and is now available for home delivery in 168 cities. Locally, newspapers are the largest advertising medium. </p>\n<p>Newspapers are a less expensive advertising medium than television and provide a way for advertisers to communicate a longer, more detailed message to their audience than they can through television. Given new production techniques, advertisements can be printed in newspapers in about 48 hours, meaning newspapers are also a quick way of getting the massage out. Newspapers are often the most important form of news for a local community, and they develop a high degree of loyalty from local readers.</p>\n<p><br></p><p>Radio</p>\n<p>Advertising on radio continues to grow. Radio is often used in conjunction with outdoor billboards (\u5e7f\u544a\u724c) and the Internet to reach even more customers than television. Advertisers are likely to use radio because it is a less expensive medium than television, which means advertisers can afford to repeat their ads often. Internet companies are also turning to radio advertising. Radio provides a way for advertisers to communicate with audience members at all times of the day. Consumers listen to radio on their way to school or work, at work, on the way home, and in the evening hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Two major changes\u2014satellite and Internet radio\u2014will force radio advertisers to adapt their methods. Both of these radio forms allow listeners to tune in stations that are more distant than the local stations they could receive in the past. As a result, radio will increasingly attract target audiences who live many miles apart. </p><p><br></p>\n<p>Magazines </p>\n<p>Newsweeklies, women\u2019s titles, and business magazines have all seen in increases in advertising because they attract the high-end market. Magazines are popular with advertisers because of the narrow market that they deliver. A broadcast medium such as network television&nbsp;attracts&nbsp;all types of audience members, but magazine audiences are more homogeneous. If you read \"Sports Illustrated\", for example, you have much in common with the magazine\u2019s other readers. Advertisers see magazines as an efficient way of reaching target audience members.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisers using the print media - magazines and newspapers - will need to adapt to two main changes. First, the Internet will bring larger audiences to local newspapers. These audiences will be more diverse and geographically dispersed(\u5206\u6563) than in the past. Second,&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;will have to understand how to use an increasing number of magazines for their target audiences. Although some magazines will maintain national audiences, a large number of magazines will entertain narrower audiences.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Out-of-home advertising</p><p>Out-of-home advertising, also called place-based advertising, has become an increasingly&nbsp;effective&nbsp;way of reaching consumers, who are more active than ever before. &nbsp;Many consumers today do not sit at home and watch television. &nbsp;Using billboards, newsstands, and bus shelters for&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;is an effective way of reaching these on-the-go consumers. More consumers travel longer distances to and from work, which also makes out-of-home advertising effective. &nbsp;Technology has changed the nature of the billboard business, making it a more effective medium than in the past. &nbsp;Using digital printing, billboard companies can print a billboard in 2 hours, compared with 6 days previously. &nbsp;This allows advertisers more variety in the types of messages they create because they can change their messages more quickly.</p><p><br></p><p>Internet </p>\n<p>As consumers become more comfortable with online shopping, advertisers will seek to reach this market. As consumers get more of their news and information from the Internet, the ability of television and radio to get the word out to consumers will decrease.&nbsp;The challenge to Internet advertisers is to create ads that audience members remember.&nbsp;</p><p>Internet advertising will play a more prominent role in organizations\u2019 advertising in the near&nbsp;future. Internet audiences tend to be quite homogeneous, but small. Advertisers will have to adjust their methods to reach these audiences and will have to adapt their persuasive strategies to the online medium as well.</p><p><br></p>\n<p>Direct mail&nbsp;</p><p>A final advertising medium is direct mail, which uses mailings to consumers to communicate a client's message. Direct mail includes newsletters, postcards and special promotions. Direct mail is an effective way to build relationships with consumers. For many businesses, direct mail is the most effective from of advertising.</p>\n                    ",

    "title":"&nbsp;Six Secrets of High-Energy People<br />\n&nbsp;There\u2019s an energy crisis in America, and it has nothing to do with fossil fuels. Millions of us get up each morning already weary over the day holds. \u201cI just can\u2019t get started\u201d people say. But it\u2019s not physical energy that most of us lack. Sure, we could all use extra sleep and a better diet. But in truth, people are healthier today than at any time in history. I can almost guarantee that if you long for more energy, the problem is not with your body.<br />\n&nbsp;What you\u2019re seeking is not physical energy. It\u2019s emotional energy. Yet, sad to say life sometimes seems designed to exhaust our supply. We work too hard. We have family obligations. We encounter emergencies and personal crises. No wonder so many of us suffer from emotional fatigue, a kind of utter exhaustion of the spirit.<br />\n&nbsp;And yet we all know people who are filled with joy, despite the unpleasant circum stances of their lives. Eyen as a child observed people who were poor or disabled or ill, but who nonetheless faced life with optimism and vigor. Consider Laura Hillenbrand, who despite an extremely weak body wrote the best-seller Seabiscuit. Hillenbrand barely had enough physical energy to drag herself out of be to write. But she was fueled by having a story she wanted to share. It was emotional energy that helped her succeed.<br />\n&nbsp;Unlike physical energy, which is finite and diminishes with age, emotional energy is unlimited and has nothing to do with genes or up bringing. So how do you get it? You can\u2019t simply tell yourself to be positive. You must take action. Here are six practical strategies that work.<br />\n&nbsp;1.Do something new.<br />\n&nbsp;Very little that\u2019s new occurs in our lives. The impact of this sameness on our emotional energy is gradual, but huge: It's like a tire with a slow leak. You don't it at first, but eventually you'll get a flat. It's up to you to plug the leak--even though there are always a dozen reasons to stay stuck in your dull routines of life. That's where Maura, 36, a waitress, found herself a year ago.<br />\n&nbsp;Fortunately, Maura had a lifeline--a group of women friends who meet regularly to discuss their lives. Their lively discussions spurred Maura to make small but nevertheless life altering changes. She joined a gym in the next town. She changed her look with a short haircut and new black T-shirts. Eventually, Maura gathered the courage to quit her job and start her own business.<br />\n&nbsp;Here's a challenge: If it's something you wouldn't ordinarily do, do it. Try a dish you've never eaten. Listen to music you'd ordinarily tune out. You'll discover these small things add to your emotional energy.<br />\n&nbsp;2.Reclaim life's meaning.<br />\n&nbsp;So many of my patients tell me that their lives used to have meaning, but that somewhere along the line things went state.<br />\n&nbsp;The first step in solving this meaning shortage is to figure out what you really care about, and then do something about it. A case in point is Ivy, 57, a pioneer in investment banking. \"I mistakenly believed that all the money I made would mean something.\" she says. \"But I feel lost, like a 22-year-old wondering what to do with her life.\" Ivy's solution? She started a program that shows Wall Streeters how to donate time and money to poor children. In the process, Ivy filled her life with meaning.<br />\n&nbsp;3.Put yourself in the fun zone.<br />\n&nbsp;Most of us grown-ups are seriously fun-deprived. High-energy people have the same day-to-day work as the rest of us, but they manage to find something enjoyable in every situation. A real estate broker I know keeps herself amused on the job by mentally redecorating the houses she shows to clients. \"I love imagining what even the most run-down house could look like withy a little tender loving care,\" she says. \"It's a challenge--and the least desirable properties are usually the most fun.\"<br />\n&nbsp;We all define fun differently, of course, but I can guarantee this: If you put just a bit of it into your day, you energy will increase quickly.<br />\n&nbsp;4.Bid farewell to guilt and regret.<br />\n&nbsp;Everyone's past is filled with regrets that still cause pain. But from an emotional energy point of view, they are dead weights that keep us from us from moving forward. While they can't merely be willed away, I do recommend you remind yourself that whatever happened is in the past, and nothing can change that. Holding on to the memory only allows the damage to continue into the present.<br />\n&nbsp;5.Make up your mind.<br />\n&nbsp;Say you\u2019ve been thinking about cutting your hair short. Will it look stylish \u2013 or too extreme?<br />\n&nbsp;You endlessly think it over. Having the decision hanging over your head is a huge energy drain.<br />\n&nbsp;Every time you can\u2019t decide, you burden yourself with alternatives. Quit thinking that you have to make the right decision; instead, make a choice and don\u2019t look back.<br />\n&nbsp;6.Give to get.<br />\n&nbsp;Emotional energy has a kind of magical quality; the more you give, the more you get back. This is the difference between emotional and physical energy. With the latter., You have to get it to be able to give it. With the former, however, you get it by giving it.<br />\n&nbsp;Start by asking everyone you meet, \u201cHow are you?\u201d as if you really want to know, then listen to the reply. Be the one who hears. Most of us also need to smile more often. If you don\u2019t smile at the person you love first thing in the morning, you\u2019re sucking energy out of your relationship. Finally, help another person\u2014and make the help real, concrete. Give a massage (\u6309\u6469) to someone you love, or cook her dinner, Then, expand the circle to work. Try asking yourself what you\u2019d do if your goal were to be helpful rather than efficient.<br />\n&nbsp;After all, if it\u2019s true that what goes around comes around, why not make sure that what\u2019s circulating around you is the good stuff?",
